        Representation of Abilities in Glee
      </h1>
      <p id="info" class="subtitle has-text-primary-light">
        One of the biggest controversies that came from Glee was when it was realized that Kevin McHale, the actor who played the paraplegic teen in the show, wasn’t actually paraplegic in real life. There are even episodes throughout the show, in Artie’s dreams or daydreams, where McHale gets out of his wheelchair and starts to dance. In today’s modern media, there are already so many false representations of disability that are mainly based around stereotypes. In a show that wanted to give a platform to every part of every character correctly and fairly, it was surprising to learn that they used an “able-bodied” actor to depict a paraplegic teen. 

        he has a Christmas wish granted by gaining one of these new apparatuses which enables him to stand up and walk, and it’s portrayed as kind of a Christmas miracle and it’s extraordinarily patronizing and a lot of people with disabilities found it extremely irritating, including people on our panel.

        But the feel good show is not without its critics, particularly from the disability community. While media reports in such high profile outlets as People Magazine and US Magazine and trade publications like Hollywood Reporter and Variety have centered on the casting of Kevin McHale as paraplegic wheelchair-using Artie, deeper criticisms regarding plot, tone and representation have received minimal coverage in comparison.

        If it were only that easy. There’s an understanding of embodiment that’s just not physical in McHale’s portrayal of Artie, and for me, what I see is a huge gap between the body and the chair. He doesn’t even understand how to push that thing. There’s a kind of sweet roll that those of us who use manual wheelchairs can find and use and McHale is always shown shoving and pushing. There’s no rhythm, there’s no feel, there’s no understanding of the chair as part of his body.

        just I feel like there’s a couple of different problems with the casting of Artie. One is that, as an actor in the disabled community trying to do my own script, which I wrote, I can’t even get directors to screen test me in my own role as a character with cerebral palsy. As I go from producer to producer, director to director, they do not want to give disabled actors a chance to play disabled parts. Not to mention non-disabled roles. So my first problem with Artie is that I simply do not believe that Ryan Murphy exhausted all options in finding a singer who could sing and dance miraculously and gorgeously, that he couldn’t heal. And I think they intentionally chose an able-bodied actor so they could get him out of the chair to sing and dance whenever they wanted. There’s a problem in Hollywood, there’s a problem in television, that is disabled actors are not given a chance to play neutral roles, and we’re also not given a chance to play our own roles, and we think that only someone mimicing it can win an Oscar. I have Cerebral Palsy. I think Daniel Day Lewis’ portrayal in My Left Foot was absolutely disgusting. So what we see and what the other people see are not the same thing. And when Kevin McHale commented “why can he play gay”, it’s not the same thing. Anyone can play gay, but I can’t play Oprah because I’m white. And he should not be–

        ” And most of the messages that Glee sends about disabilities are actively damaging to the disability community, whether there are disabled or non-disabled actors.

        Also prominently seen within the show is the theme of “curing” one’s disability. This
        topic involves the idea that disabilities need to be fixed or corrected for the person to have a
        happy and fulfilled life. Artie, especially struggles with the fact that he is in a wheelchair. In
        “Dream On,” a school board representative asks the club to write down their dreams, and it is
        Artie’s written dream that he balls up and throws into a trashcan. Tina, Artie’s girlfriend at the 
        31
        time, discovers he wants to dance, and fans Artie’s hopes for a future cure with scientific studies
        that would lead him to achieving his dream. After an embarrassing incident where Artie falls on
        his face in front of Tina while attempting to dance, Artie gets frustrated asking her to go away
        and he says, “We shouldn’t have done this, you pushed me to do this.” This expresses how upset
        he is by being reminded of his disability and how it hinders his ability to walk and dance. His
        wishes are expressed in a dream sequence later on, where Artie tells Tina “My doctor is starting
        me on the treatments you’d mentioned…and guess what they’re working,” and he gets out of the
        wheelchair to dance and sing in a flash mob. This seems to portray that with a disability, one
        cannot achieve their dreams, and finding a “cure” is the only answer. It also is interesting, that
        the largest highlight of the character Artie Abrams within the concert involves him not in his
        wheelchair, dancing to the song portrayed within this dream sequence.
        Artie brings his newfound belief in his ability to walk to his guidance counselor, Emma,
        saying, “When I start walking, I’m going to need help adjusting to my drastically altered
        lifestyle.” Emma reveals she has read his file previously and the damage to his spinal cord was
        severe and irreversible and that the research was in very early stages. She suggests that he should
        come to see her once a week for a while, and he leaves dejected. Her message in the episode is
        that the Hollywood presentation of a miracle cure does not reflect real life circumstances, and
        that the regular curing of severe disability is still far out of the reach of today’s medical science.
        Artie ends up not dancing, calling himself half a partner, and saying he will never dance,
        but he has accepted it saying, “I have to focus on dreams that can come true.” Inevitably this
        portrays that with a disability, there are things someone cannot do, which is not necessarily true.
        The only solution provided by the show to actually be able to achieve a physical dream like
        dancing is curing the disability that hinders it. Later on, in “A Very Glee Christmas” Brittany, 
        32
        (Artie’s new girlfriend that is also in glee club) makes a wish with Santa Clause for Artie to
        walk, which does not offend him. He tells her, “Hey, look at me. I’m fine,” which shows that he
        is more accepting at that time of his disability. He works the rest of the episode to get Coach
        Beiste (the school’s new football coach) to tell Brittany it is not possible for him to walk. Coach
        Beiste ends up getting Artie a ReWalk machine, which is a form of assistive technology that
        allows him to take steps when he uses it. 



        Similarly, Artie is treated differently, in particular, by the positions of authority within
the school, which sometimes further his isolation and diminish him in comparison to other
characters on the show. In the “Pilot” Figgins, the school’s principal says, “What is it with you
and this club? You’ve got five kids. One of them’s a cripple,” which insinuates that Artie’s
disability puts him on a lesser level than the other glee club members. Also, in “Acafellas,” when
the choreographer Dakota Stanley comes in, he kicks Artie out right off the bat saying, “Artie
you’re cut, you’re not trying hard enough…at walking! Can’t be wheeling you around every
number, throws off the whole dynamic, and it’s depressing.” Likewise, Coach Sue Sylvester tells
Will Schuester, the choir director, “You need twelve kids to compete at Regionals. Last I looked,
you only had five and a half: cripple in the wheelchair.”


It seems at times there is an over-emphasis on disability, as though the disability is all
there is to the character. This overemphasis can be seen in the introduction of the characters
where, on several occasions, the disability was introduced as the first thing we know about the
character. Artie is first seen only signing up for glee club in his wheelchair, and that is all the
information we are given at the time.
