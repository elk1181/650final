        Given the quote, my research question is how effective was <em>Glee</em>'s disability representation given Artie's protrayal by an abled actor and how was the character portrayed on screen

        Research Findings from Articles
       </h1>

<p> After examining research and clips of <em>Glee</em>, I decided to focus my investigation on the casting of McHale as Artie as well as the portrayal/treatment of the character himself in the show.
   </p>

  <h1 class="title"> Casting of Artie</h1>
  <img src="https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/20221017/rs_1200x1200-221117093058-1200-Kevin-McHale-Glee-LT-111722-GettyImages-467386448.jpg?fit=around%7C1080:1080&output-quality=90&crop=1080:1080;center,top" alt="Mercedes" width="200" height="200"> (Eonline)

  <h2 class="subtitle"> As seen from the show itself as well as articles, Artie was one of the original main cast members. He is portrayed as a parapalygic member of the Glee Club who was wheelchair bound after a car accident in his youth. <br> However, he is portrayed by the able actor, Kevin McHale  </h2>
<br> <br>
<div style="background-color:antiquewhite">
  <h1 class = "title"> </h1>
  <h2 class="subtitle"> This problem had actually angered viewers since the beginning of the show back in 2009 with disability advocates upset that it caused an opportunity for a wheel chair bound actor to get a role in Hollywood. The following excert came from the Hollywood Reporter after the release of the episode Wheels which foucused on Artie and his disability where the members of the Glee Club were required to spend a week in wheelchairs, "The scene in Wednesday’s episode of the hit Fox series “Glee,” which regularly celebrates diversity and the underdog, is yet another uplifting moment — except to those in the entertainment industry with disabilities and their advocates.

    For them, the casting of a nondisabled actor to play the paraplegic high school student is another blown chance to hire a performer who truly fits the role (ASSOCIATED PRESS 2009)."</h2>

    <h1 class = "title"> Accuracy of Performance</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle"> Disability advocates had a deep problem with McHale's performance. According to the site, Disabled Feminists which focused on an interview discussing McHale's performance in Glee. "If it were only that easy. There’s an understanding of embodiment that’s just not physical in McHale’s portrayal of Artie, and for me, what I see is a huge gap between the body and the chair. He doesn’t even understand how to push that thing. There’s a kind of sweet roll that those of us who use manual wheelchairs can find and use and McHale is always shown shoving and pushing. There’s no rhythm, there’s no feel, there’s no understanding of the chair as part of his body (Disabled Feminists 2010)."

              <p class="title is-4"> Kendra Curtis from the blog site, Challenging Bodies, comments on moments like the aforementioned with the following excerpt. </p>
              <p class="subtitle is-6"> "There are even episodes throughout the show, in Artie’s dreams or daydreams, where McHale gets out of his wheelchair and starts to dance. In today’s modern media, there are already so many false representations of disability that are mainly based around stereotypes. In a show that wanted to give a platform to every part of every character correctly and fairly, it was surprising to learn that they used an “able-bodied” actor to depict a paraplegic teen (Curtis 2018)."

      </div>


      <p class="subtitle">
        To summarize the miscasting, "McHale plays Artie because the disability discourse of Hollywood cannot see movement in the language of wheeled life, dominated by terms such as "bound" and "confined." Hollywood all too regularly conflates paralyzed with petrified, thereby denying the possibility, or even the permissibility of pleasurable, professional movement in a disabled body. Casting McHale continues the tradition of fear around disability in the public eye, reinforces the incorrect idea that disabled actors cannot work regularly and reliably, and furthers the prejudicial systems that make it nearly impossible for a disabled person both to train as an actor and/or dancer and to get work. Neither the television nor movie world seems to understand the relationship between a single moving disabled body and a larger corpus of disabled people, be they on stage, in the studio, on the street or, for example, at SDS 2010 in a dance flash mob at a busy Philadelphia intersection. Neither realm admits the possibility that a single moving disabled body is deeply rooted in the disability movement, that it is a symbol of our past and a sign of our future: One disabled body may dance by itself, but never alone (DSQ 2011)."

<h1 class="subtitle"> <em>Glee</em> features several episodes which focus on "fixing" Artie </h1>

<p class="subtitle">
"While media reports in such high profile outlets as People Magazine and US Magazine and trade publications like Hollywood Reporter and Variety have centered on the casting of Kevin McHale as paraplegic wheelchair-using Artie, deeper criticisms regarding plot, tone and representation have received minimal coverage in comparison (Disabled Feminists 2010)."

</p>

<div style="background-color:cadetblue">
  ”And most of the messages that <em>Glee</em> sends about disabilities are actively damaging to the disability community, whether there are disabled or non-disabled actors (Disabled Feminists 2010)."

        The idea of "curing" a disability is brought up significiantly in a thesis from Middle Tennesee University       
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="message-body">
      "Also prominently seen within the show is the theme of “curing” one’s disability. This
topic involves the idea that disabilities need to be fixed or corrected for the person to have a
happy and fulfilled life. Artie, especially struggles with the fact that he is in a wheelchair. In
“Dream On,” a school board representative asks the club to write down their dreams, and it is
Artie’s written dream that he balls up and throws into a trashcan. Tina, Artie’s girlfriend at the 
time, discovers he wants to dance, and fans Artie’s hopes for a future cure with scientific studies
that would lead him to achieving his dream. After an embarrassing incident where Artie falls on
his face in front of Tina while attempting to dance, Artie gets frustrated asking her to go away
and he says, “We shouldn’t have done this, you pushed me to do this.” This expresses how upset
he is by being reminded of his disability and how it hinders his ability to walk and dance. His
wishes are expressed in a dream sequence later on, where Artie tells Tina “My doctor is starting
me on the treatments you’d mentioned…and guess what they’re working,” and he gets out of the
wheelchair to dance and sing in a flash mob. This seems to portray that with a disability, one
cannot achieve their dreams, and finding a “cure” is the only answer. It also is interesting, that
the largest highlight of the character Artie Abrams within the concert involves him not in his
wheelchair, dancing to the song portrayed within this dream sequence (Levins 30)."

            "He has a Christmas wish granted by gaining one of these new apparatuses which enables him to stand up and walk, and it’s portrayed as kind of a Christmas miracle and it’s extraordinarily patronizing and a lot of people with disabilities found it extremely irritating, including people on our panel (Disabled Feminists 2010)."


          </div>
          <div class="content">
            This occurs in another episode Season one Dreams where Artie and Tina attempt to look into spinal cord treatment surgery that is unfortunately put down by Emma, the school guidance counselor.
            <div style="background-color:darkolivegreen; color: white">
             "Artie brings his newfound belief in his ability to walk to his guidance counselor, Emma,
              saying, “When I start walking, I’m going to need help adjusting to my drastically altered
              lifestyle.” Emma reveals she has read his file previously and the damage to his spinal cord was
              severe and irreversible and that the research was in very early stages. She suggests that he should
              come to see her once a week for a while, and he leaves dejected. Her message in the episode is
              that the Hollywood presentation of a miracle cure does not reflect real life circumstances, and
              that the regular curing of severe disability is still far out of the reach of today’s medical science.
              Artie ends up not dancing, calling himself half a partner, and saying he will never dance,
              but he has accepted it saying, “I have to focus on dreams that can come true.” Inevitably this
              portrays that with a disability, there are things someone cannot do, which is not necessarily true.
              The only solution provided by the show to actually be able to achieve a physical dream like
              dancing is curing the disability that hinders it. Later on, in “A Very Glee Christmas” Brittany, 
              (Artie’s new girlfriend that is also in glee club) makes a wish with Santa Clause for Artie to
              walk, which does not offend him. He tells her, “Hey, look at me. I’m fine,” which shows that he
              is more accepting at that time of his disability. He works the rest of the episode to get Coach
              Beiste (the school’s new football coach) to tell Brittany it is not possible for him to walk. Coach
              Beiste ends up getting Artie a ReWalk machine, which is a form of assistive technology that
              allows him to take steps when he uses it (Levins 31)."

    <p> Another important aspect of the disability representation is Artie's lack of a backstory or personality outside of being the "boy in the wheelchair. This is researched on in Levins' thesis on disability representation in <em>Glee</em>, which includes the follow excerpts on comments made about Artie throughout the series. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="message-body">


    "It seems at times there is an over-emphasis on disability, as though the disability is all
    there is to the character. This overemphasis can be seen in the introduction of the characters
    where, on several occasions, the disability was introduced as the first thing we know about the
    character. Artie is first seen only signing up for glee club in his wheelchair, and that is all the
    information we are given at the time (Levins 68)."

  </div>

  <div class="message-body">
    <section class="content">
      <div style="background-color:darksalmon">
        "Similarly, Artie is treated differently, in particular, by the positions of authority within
        the school, which sometimes further his isolation and diminish him in comparison to other
        characters on the show. In the “Pilot” Figgins, the school’s principal says, “What is it with you
        and this club? You’ve got five kids. One of them’s a cripple,” which insinuates that Artie’s
        disability puts him on a lesser level than the other glee club members. Also, in “Acafellas,” when
        the choreographer Dakota Stanley comes in, he kicks Artie out right off the bat saying, “Artie
        you’re cut, you’re not trying hard enough…at walking! Can’t be wheeling you around every
        number, throws off the whole dynamic, and it’s depressing.” Likewise, Coach Sue Sylvester tells
        Will Schuester, the choir director, “You need twelve kids to compete at Regionals. Last I looked,
        you only had five and a half: cripple in the wheelchair (Levins 37).”

<h1 class="title">In Summary</h1>
  <div class="notification is-primary">
  
Despite good intentions, according to the disability community and research papers, <em>Glee</em>'s portrayal and casting decisions have led to damanaging effects for its representation. This includes the selection of Kevin McHale as Artie as well as continued storylines that offended those from the disability community, and the continued offensive comments about Artie being less of a person for being in a wheelchair.
