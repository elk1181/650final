        The Initial Start of the Research
      </h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        When beginning the research on racial representation, I came across an article that really began to stir questions.
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">
    In 2011, around the second season of <em>Glee</em>, an article called "Sing the black away: Does 'Glee' avoid exploring race?" was released by The Grio, a blog focused on African Americans in Culture and News which discussed the lack of discussion of race on the show and the lack of depth of the POC characters, specifically Mercedes Jones.
      </p>


      <article class="message">
        <div class="message-header">
          <p>Does '<em>Glee</em>' avoid exploring race? </p>
        </div>
        <div class="message-body">
          "About a year ago, I noted that it seemed Riley’s character was cast to be simply the sassy, eye-rolling black girl. There was no depth to her character and even as the show winds down its second season, there still is nothing about Mercedes’ character that feels authentic (The Grio 2011)."
        </div>
      </article>
      <h1 class="title">
       Research Question
      </h1>
      <div class="notification is-link">
        As a result of this quote, I realized my research question: while Glee does in fact have main characters that are people of color, is the representation positive or does it give into sterotypes? 
      </div>

      <h1 class="title">
        Research Findings from Articles
       </h1>

<p> Based on research found, I decided to focus my investigation on three central characters: Mercedes Jones, Tina Cohen-Chang, and Mike Chang. </p>


<section> 
  <h1 class="title"> Mercedes Jones</h1>
  <img src="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/test-resources/pics/GLEE/8.jpg" alt="Mercedes" width="200" height="200"> (openpsychometrics.org)

  <h2 class="subtitle"> As seen from the show itself as well as articles, Mercedes was one of the original main cast members. However, as compared to other characters like Rachel Berry, she is hardly given any backstory or depth. While other characters get stories about their home lives and what they want to do after high school, Mercedes gets minimal stories with little to no indication of a life outside of the Glee club </h2>

<div style="background-color:antiquewhite">
  <h1 class = "title"> Opinions found during original run</h1>
  <h2 class="subtitle"> This problem has not only been seen in 2022 but also at the very beginning of <em>Glee</em>'s syndication in 2009. According to the website, Popmatters and their article "Is 'Glee a little bit racist', "The non-white character that has come closest to actually becoming a full-fledged character is Mercedes. She can sing like nobody’s business and has been given the spotlight in a few musical numbers. She even had one B-storyline when she had a crush on the gay kid. But again, it ended up that she was a foil to push him in the direction of coming out of the closet. We know that her dad is a dentist because she told us, but like the other non-white characters, we have never met any of her family members on the show. This would not be a problem if this was a high school show that took place only in the high school. Except it doesn’t. We’ve met parents and siblings for five of the seven white kids. (For the record, the two white kids with absentee families are the disabled guy and the girl who is being portrayed as the dumbest blonde ever to put on a cheerleading outfit.) (Landweber 2009)."</h2>

  <div style="background-color:aqua">
    <h1 class = "title"> After Glee ended</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle"> The review site Roger Ebert even makes a comment about Mercedes and Black representation on Glee during their Black Writers Week by saying "Mercedes was the main lead and played the “strong black woman” trope but they barely went into her backstory until right before she ended the series (Ifeguni 2022)." The site even created an infograph that placed different teen dramas on a scale based on their black representation. As seen from below, Glee falls fairly low on the list just a little over non-recogntion to ridicule. </h2>

</div>

<h2 class="subtitle">A major aspect of Mercedes' character has to do with her constantly being second to white character, Rachel Berry who continously gets all of the solos in the club and is seen as her rival for the spotlight, when looking at the show from a racial lens, the difference in treatment between Rachel and Mercedes is often mentioned especially in the following research article. </h2>

<h2 class="subtitle"> An article that will be mentioned a few times in this section comes from a thesis by Benjamin R. Phelps at Tufts University who studied "Discursive (Re)Productions of ‘Post’-Race Schooling:
  <em>Glee</em> and the Post-Racial Gaze" which goes over <em>Glee</em> and how it is seen from a racial gaze. The paper, which has a section on Mercedes, focuses on the scene below from the season 2 episode "Night of Neglect" (Brennan 2011). </h2>

          <div class="content">
            "Mercedes openly questions why she is consistently
            overshadowed by Rachel, despite their evidently equal talent: “I don’t get it. Why
            are you a bigger star than me? You always get the big solos, the best songs, the
            moments in the sun. Why is it never me?” Rachel pauses for a moment, before
            answering, “I don’t know.” Here, Glee creates the perfect opportunity to discuss
            the reality of race and the ways it generates differential outcomes for its two star
            talents, yet it backs away from articulating that reality because the post-racial
            framework within which the show operates does not allow for an open discussion
            of something we are “past.” But that is the purpose of the exchange: not to foster
            a racial dialogue, but to signal a post-race reality where success is due to drive,
            commitment, and intangibles. Instead, the institutional practices and cultural
            representations of racial difference contribute to an understanding of difference on
            a purely individual level, wherein variable outcomes are simply the result of
            personal characteristics or traits that are natural and fixed and not a part of a
            larger social, historical, and political context (Phelps 61).""

        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="subtitle">
        From the text from the research as well as the content from the video, it is seen that the show misses clear oportunites to discuss race and the bias there can be which makes the audiance question whether or not the creators of Glee are even aware of the biases themselves or are they indulging them and believing themselves to be better due to their inclusion of a African-American main character. 
      </p>


      <p class="subtitle">
        This is further summarized by Phelps in this statement:
        "The post-racial gaze decouples race from power,
        neutralizing concerns that Mercedes embodies stereotypical image, or that she
        remain subordinate in both the glee club and the show’s ensemble to the White
        female lead; instead, Mercedes simply becomes another token of <em>Glee</em>’s
        progressiveness, and criticisms to the contrary can just be labeled racist in and of
        themselves (Phelps 111)."

<h1 class="subtitle"> Glee features two Asian-American characters, Tina and Mike.  </h1>


<h2 class="subtitle"> From the research and views of Glee, both Tina and Mike (for characters who have been on the show since the beginning) have minimal plot development and backgrounds outside of the characters themselves</h2>



<section class="content">
  A major discussion of Asian representation in <em>Glee</em> seems to be related to two aspects: "satirc" use of sterotypes but without aknowledgement and neglect of the characters

  <article class="message">
    <div class="message-header"  style="background-color:cornflowerblue">
      <p> The characters were also seen to be fairly neglected in comparison to the white main characters with Tina nor Mike being given many solos or storylines.</p>

    <div class="message-body">
<ul>
  <li> "Mike Chang’s character is also part of the original glee club, though he was seen as a more minor character than Tina, his Asian counterpart. Mike faces a similar issue as the other POC characters on <em>Glee</em> – he does not receive his own storyline until much later on in the show and until then, his family and background are not explored at all (Popculturepeace)." </li>
<br> <br> <li> "Despite appearing in the show from the first episode, Tina Cohen-Chang was never given the solos or airtime she deserved. For the entire show, she was considered a side character and was promised a solid storyline when she was a senior, but it just never happened. The only time she even came close to being the lead of a song was with PSY’s Gangnam Style, most likely because she was the token Asian girl (Wong 2021)." </li>

            "They met as counselors at what the show
      calls “Asian Camp.” In the premiere of season two, their status as a couple is revealed
      when the episode cuts to a flashback of Mike and Tina kissing at camp in front of Asian
      children who, although they look around five years old, were all proficient in the usage of
      camera-enabled cell phones and sat in a room whose walls were decorated with Chinese
      calligraphy (Wo 23)."

  <section class="content">
    <div style="background-color:darksalmon">
    For example, according to a research paper of Asian representation in Media from Scripps College, the scene above seems to be a satire on common Asian sterotypes in Western mediia. 
    <br>
    "<em>Glee</em>’s
    representation of Asian American characters walks a fine line between presenting
    positive role models and propagating dangerous clichés."
    and 
    "while the show may be
    using irony to make humor of Asian American stereotypes and possibly attempting to
    send the message that they are problematic, the situations such as toddlers being able to
    use camera phones, only eating dim sum and parents being upset over an A- are presented
    as real (Wo 26)."
</div>

    <br>

    <br>
<div style="background-color:darkolivegreen">
These jokes are continued throughout the show, with the two characters using common sterotypes with little to no aknowledgement of them being jokes or not - simply depicted in the plot of the show with no context.
<br> 
For example, one blog post mentions the episode "Born This Way" in which Tina discusses wearing colored contacts much to the despair of Mike, simply played for laughs.
  "I got my hopes up when Tina had some dialogue in the ‘Born This Way’ episode where they talked about her wearing blue contacts and how she hated her eyes. But the conversation ended with Mike calling her a ‘self-hating Asian’ (don’t even get me started on Mike who barely talks). No discussion around why Tina felt this way, how Asians will often get surgery to make their eyes look bigger (and more ‘westernized’) or the stereotypes that come with how mainstream society deems what is beautiful and what isn’t (Yin 2011)."

<br>
  <br>

  <div style="background-color:cadetblue">
    Another example of this comes from the coach Sue Sylvester who repeatly calls Tina and Mike by "Asian" and "Other Asian" throughout the series.
"Reformulated as a post-racial
model minority, she [Tina] both reflects old stereotypes and rejects them for updates on
the classic tropes, yet the result in either case is her being confined to a supporting
role in both the glee club and the overall show. She is perhaps the most obvious
and literal tool for post-racialism and the post-racial gaze, as Sue Sylvester and
others refer to her simply as “Asian,” but that ostensible joke serves not to prove a
racial transcendence, but rather to perpetuate a racial hierarchy with Whiteness on
top (Phelps 108)."

<br> 

</div>
</div>
<br>
<article class="message is-info">
  <div class="message-header">
    <p>The use of these sterotypes and jokes are seen to negatively affect Tina and Mike's character development. In Phelps' thesis from Tufts University on people of color in <em>Glee</em>, Tina as a character is analyzed in which it is stated that being Asian is portrayed as Tina's identifying personality and little to no character development occurs beyond that. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="message-body">
    "Constant references to
    her Asian identity do the work of post-racialism in bringing that identity to the
    forefront. By frequently commenting on her Asianness, but in ways that
    decontextualize that identity from broader structures, the show is able to “prove”
    a post-race reality. <em>Glee</em> signals that her being Asian is an actual identity, but
    attached only to culture and not material difference through race, and that it is
    worthy of mention, but most often in the form of a joke or throwaway line. She
    becomes solely defined by her racial identity, but the show never moves beyond
    her simply being Asian American to address how that fact affects and shapes her
    experiences (Phelps 83)."  </div>

<h1 class="title">In Summary</h1>
  <div class="notification is-primary">
    A great quote to summarize the POC representation findings: "while I would like to see more substantive representation of
    historically marginalized groups on television—pushing beyond “diversity for
    diversity’s sake” and moving people of Color into well-developed leading roles,
    to start—it is beyond the purview of this thesis to provide lengthy prescriptions
    for an entrenched and deeply hegemonic media industry (Phelps 112)"
