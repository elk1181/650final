        The Inital Start of the Research
      </h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        When beginning the research on racial representation, I came across an article that really began to stir questions.
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">
    In 2011, around the second season of Glee, an article called "Sing the black away: Does 'Glee' avoid exploring race?" was released by The Grio, a blog focused on African Americans in Culture and News which discussed the lack of discussion of race on the show and the lack of depth of the POC characters, specifcially Mercedes Jones.

          "About a year ago, I noted that it seemed Riley’s character was cast to be simply the sassy, eye-rolling black girl. There was no depth to her character and even as the show winds down its second season, there still is nothing about Mercedes’ character that feels authentic (The Grio 2011)."

        As a result of this quote, I realized my research question: while Glee does in fact have main characters that are people of color, is the representation positive or does it give into sterotypes?

            In fact, during a season two episode, “A Night of Neglect,” Mercedes
            nearly broaches the topic of race with Rachel. In a similar conflict to that
            surrounding West Side Story, Mercedes openly questions why she is consistently
            overshadowed by Rachel, despite their evidently equal talent: “I don’t get it. Why
            are you a bigger star than me? You always get the big solos, the best songs, the
            moments in the sun. Why is it never me?” Rachel pauses for a moment, before
            answering, “I don’t know.” Here, Glee creates the perfect opportunity to discuss
            the reality of race and the ways it generates differential outcomes for its two star
            talents, yet it backs away from articulating that reality because the post-racial
            framework within which the show operates does not allow for an open discussion
            of something we are “past.” But that is the purpose of the exchange: not to foster
            a racial dialogue, but to signal a post-race reality where success is due to drive,
            commitment, and intangibles. Instead, the institutional practices and cultural
            representations of racial difference contribute to an understanding of difference on
            a purely individual level, wherein variable outcomes are simply the result of
            personal characteristics or traits that are natural and fixed and not a part of a
            larger social, historical, and political context.

"The post-racial gaze decouples race from power,
neutralizing concerns that Mercedes embodies stereotypical image, or that she
remain subordinate in both the glee club and the show’s ensemble to the White
female lead; instead, Mercedes simply becomes another token of Glee’s
progressiveness, and criticisms to the contrary can just be labeled racist in and of
themselves"





Although she is positioned as an equal talent to Rachel, Mercedes is
consistently denied her subjectivity through her characterization, made up of
various updated stereotypes of Black women, and her storylines, in which she 
largely plays a supporting role. In fact, even in the plots in which she does not
directly support Rachel, Mercedes’ presence functions to buttress the ideal White
womanhood represented by Rachel and to be a representative object of the
diversity and inclusion of the show. The post-racial gaze naturalizes these
positions to make them appear normal and, in fact, positive and desirable.
Because race is decoupled from power, there can be no valid concern that
Mercedes embodies the mammy image, or that she must remain subordinate in
both the glee club and the show’s ensemble to the White female lead; instead,
Mercedes simply becomes another token of Glee’s progressiveness, and criticisms
to the contrary can just be labeled racist in and of themselves. However, by
adopting this gaze, Glee ultimately undermines its own purported goal—though I
would question its veracity in the first place—by redeeming Whiteness and
dominant ideologies through the objectification and marginalization of characters
of Color.

"While I would like to see more substantive representation of
historically marginalized groups on television—pushing beyond “diversity for
diversity’s sake” and moving people of Color into well-developed leading roles,
to start—it is beyond the purview of this thesis to provide lengthy prescriptions
for an entrenched and deeply hegemonic media industry"

because diversity and racial inclusion are signs of having “arrived” in a post-racial
era when race and racism are no longer concerning issues. Mercedes’ presence on
Glee is just one step in the show’s attempt to represent everybody from every
identity group, in order to prove true racial progress and transcendence, but her
marginal position ultimately justifies Rachel’s centrality. By making Rachel’s
higher position a natural consequence of her own superior ambition—and thus 
Mercedes’ failure to attain the same level a consequence of her own shortcomings
and lack of ambition—Glee redeems Whiteness in the form of Rachel. The two
characters are ostensibly positioned on an equal playing field with the same
opportunities, yet one consistently finds greater success, more screen time, and
more narrative thrust, signaling that they ultimately deserve their respective
positions.

Reformulated as a post-racial
model minority, she both reflects old stereotypes and rejects them for updates on
the classic tropes, yet the result in either case is her being confined to a supporting
role in both the glee club and the overall show. She is perhaps the most obvious
and literal tool for post-racialism and the post-racial gaze, as Sue Sylvester and
others refer to her simply as “Asian,” but that ostensible joke serves not to prove a
racial transcendence, but rather to perpetuate a racial hierarchy with Whiteness on
top. A
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyjQigGeJQY
While Glee addresses this racial stereotype, it does not critique the social structures that marginalize Asians in society. 
dditionally, the story is confined within the “safe” space of high-school life, and we do not get to see hints of outside racism presented onscreen. By not including these important details, Mike Chang’s problem with his parents is intentionally normalized.
After critically looking at Glee’s response to Asian stereotypes, we can see the limitations of Glee. While the show does include some references to parental/societal expectations of Asians, Glee is not a show about the real-life problems of race in contemporary society (in contrast to Insecure or Master of None). 



Additionally, Tina’s narrative position and her characterization reflect
stereotypical representation of Asians and Asian Americans as “demure,
submissive, and docile” (Lee & Vaught, 2003, p. 459), and constant references to
her Asian identity do the work of post-racialism in bringing that identity to the
forefront. By frequently commenting on her Asianness, but in ways that
decontextualize that identity from broader structures, the show is able to “prove”
a post-race reality. Glee signals that her being Asian is an actual identity, but
attached only to culture and not material difference through race, and that it is
worthy of mention, but most often in the form of a joke or throwaway line. She
becomes solely defined by her racial identity, but the show never moves beyond
her simply being Asian American to address how that fact affects and shapes her
experiences.
