To Summarize        </h1>
      
  
  
        <article class="message">
          <div class="message-header">
            <p> While <em>Glee</em> was praised for its depiction of underepresented groups, when actually examining specific margelinzed groups, the show did not do as well as it seemed </p>
          </div>
          <div class="message-body">
  Both groups described in research showed that underrepresentated groups being shown on television is not enough for proper representation. The groups researched both had lack of backstories outside of their underrepresentation. The storylines they had often had them seen as second to white-able club members and it is never mentioned as being wrong, with the ramifications never being aknowledged.

        Continuous satire comments
        </h1>
        <div class="notification is-link">
        Another area that was mentioned throughout the research found was the continous mocking comments that were made towards minority characters. Tina and Mike were continously referred to as "Asian" and "Other-Asian" and Artie was often called a person and a "half", "cripple", or "wheels". All though it was portrayed as a satire, is is never seen or aknowledged as being bad with the name-calling casually occuring consistently in different episodes.

To Conclude: Season 1 Episode 7, "Throwdown"  </h1>
        <h1 class="subtitle">
To truly understand the findings in a summarized manner, clips will be used to conclude this research from the episode, Throwdown.

  <h2 class="subtitle"> Season 1's episode "Throwdown" focuses on Sue using the underrepresented students in order to turn the Glee club against Will. </h2>

              <div class="media-content">
                <p class="title is-4">  In the scene, the character Sue takes the underepresented students from the Glee club to start her own. She refers to them by a series of offensive names in order to bring them to her side, all while claiming she is trying to give them more of a voice as Will does not provide opportunites for those students. While this is seen as untrue and a way to destroy Will's reputation, a later scene in the episode makes this confusing. </p>

              (Cue The Rain 2019)
                <div class="media-content">
                <p class="title is-4">  Will claims that because they are in the Glee club, the students are all considered to be minorities. Given the episode was about the underrepresented Glee students getting more of a voice, this is invalidating towards those students and generalizes their experiences. This summarizes well what the research had found, that while the underepresented students are there on screen, their stories and voices are often silenced by white-abled characters and their experiences are generalized. This time in the series, where they finally aknowledge those students as being mistreated ends up being resolved by Will assuring that if they are in the Glee club then all of them are minorities which is inaccurate and silences those students experiences.    </p>

            </div>
        <p  class="subtitle">
Just like in this episode, while Glee attempts to display an important message on underepresented groups, the execution was not as strong as it could have been given the miscastings and lack oof proper storylines highlighing these characters experiences. The one character that did receive this treatment that was mentioned in the research was Artie however even then due to the use of an abled actor caused many disabilty advocates to believe the performance was not accurate and offensive. Representation has certainly improved since <em>Glee</em> on screen and hopefully will continue to get better and allow different people to share their stories on screen.

         Further Research Goals
        </p>
  
        <p class="subtitle">
         
         My goals for the project in the future would be to have the chance to look more into LGBTQ+ representation. The areas of research that I focused on received criticism back during the show's syndication and currently in 2022. However, discussion about problems with <em>Glee</em>'s LGBTQ+ representation has come about recently especially the show's depictation of bisexuality which was continously put down as either not real or as an excuse to cheat. Unfortunetly due to timing restraints with the coding of the website, I prioritized less discussed representations on Glee.
