        LGBTQ+ Representation in Glee
      </h1>
      <p class="subtitle has-text-primary-light">

        When it comes to LGBT teens on television, Glee holds a unique position due not only to the number of regular and recurring queer characters, which equates to seven through the first four seasons, but also to the diverse ways in which sexual orientation and identity function, relative to the LGBT characters’ lives and the impact they have on the larger narrative of the series. As with a majority of prior mainstream queer content, the concept of ‘the closet’ (the need to conceal one’s queer identity) figures somewhat prominently in most of the characters’ development. Historically, the closet has often been the defining element of LGBT narratives on television.

        “Glee’s” main problem seems to be that it presents itself as one of the most all-inclusive current television shows and the writers think they can get away with crafting stereotypical characters because they’re protected by their show’s marketing. However, their ruse could be failing; ratings for “Glee” have dropped considerably between the third and fourth season premiers.
        
        There is an insidious stereotype regarding bisexual people that Glee season 2, episode 14, promoted in "Blame it on the Alcohol." In the episode, Blaine considered he might be bisexual after kissing Rachel, and Kurt responded: “Bisexual is a term that gay guys use in high school when they want to hold hands with girls and feel like a normal person for a change." This attitude delegitimizes bisexuality by portraying it as "just a phase" as opposed to being a part of someone. This stereotype was also further promoted by Glee as by the end of the episode Blaine abandons any further exploration of bisexuality. This is disappointing because what set Glee apart from media like High School Musical was its open exploration of sexuality.

        The other harmful bisexual stereotype that was promoted on Glee was the idea that bisexual people are more likely to cheat on their partners. The bisexual character Brittany was often portrayed frequently cheating on her partners with Santana, and Santana herself bemoaned Brittany's sexuality on more than one occasion saying it made her hard to trust. There is a common trope regarding bisexual people that because they are attracted to more than one gender they are more likely to be unfaithful in a relationship. This harmful and untrue attitude was promoted by Glee on many occasions even though Brittany and Santana did eventually resolve their relationship troubles and get married.

        ithout the risk of publicly identifying as LGBT online.
Glee watchers can use the program to start conversations with friends and family
and gauge others’ reactions to its models of dealing with issues, from Kurt coming out
to his father to the meaning of safe sex for newly out gay teens. If there was one gap
our participants noted in modeling conversation, it was around how to negotiate religion and queer sexuality. (Perhaps acknowledging this absence, Ryan Murphy stated
on the 2011 reality show The Glee Project that he would like to include Christian
characters on the show.) As a symbolic cultural object, our participants often asked
friends and family members to watch the show together or talk about it, and monitored
their reactions. Watching the show and being willing to discuss it signaled to our participants that the person was, at least, open to LGBT issues.
The importance of using qualitative and quantitative data became clear while analyzing the Twitter data. We collected 450,000 tweets about Glee that included one of
three hashtags: #glee (the general tag), #klaine (a portmanteau of “Kurt” and “Blaine”),
and #brittana (a portmanteau of “Brittany” and “Santana”). We predicted that the
Klaine tag would be larger than the Brittana tag, given the popularity of the Kurt/
Blaine pairing among our interview participants and in the media at large.
