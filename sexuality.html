        LGBTQ+ Representation in Glee

        When it comes to LGBT teens on television, Glee holds a unique position due not only to the number of regular and recurring queer characters, which equates to seven through the first four seasons, but also to the diverse ways in which sexual orientation and identity function, relative to the LGBT characters’ lives and the impact they have on the larger narrative of the series. As with a majority of prior mainstream queer content, the concept of ‘the closet’ (the need to conceal one’s queer identity) figures somewhat prominently in most of the characters’ development. Historically, the closet has often been the defining element of LGBT narratives on television.

        
        
        There is an insidious stereotype regarding bisexual people that Glee season 2, episode 14, promoted in "Blame it on the Alcohol." In the episode, Blaine considered he might be bisexual after kissing Rachel, and Kurt responded: “Bisexual is a term that gay guys use in high school when they want to hold hands with girls and feel like a normal person for a change." This attitude delegitimizes bisexuality by portraying it as "just a phase" as opposed to being a part of someone. This stereotype was also further promoted by Glee as by the end of the episode Blaine abandons any further exploration of bisexuality. This is disappointing because what set Glee apart from media like High School Musical was its open exploration of sexuality.

        The other harmful bisexual stereotype that was promoted on Glee was the idea that bisexual people are more likely to cheat on their partners. The bisexual character Brittany was often portrayed frequently cheating on her partners with Santana, and Santana herself bemoaned Brittany's sexuality on more than one occasion saying it made her hard to trust. There is a common trope regarding bisexual people that because they are attracted to more than one gender they are more likely to be unfaithful in a relationship. This harmful and untrue attitude was promoted by Glee on many occasions even though Brittany and Santana did eventually resolve their relationship troubles and get married.
